it would be nice when a user have problems with going to the next postbox,
or going to the supermarket or what ever,
stucking in a fake world,
that there is a reward system to get the real world shit done while
getting distance to the fake world (like wow).

the stuff which gets collected in the real world have to be soul/account bound in the fake world,
so there is no way to trade around the personal stuff which has to be done.

could be that drops are fucking rare in fake world and can be only achived by going outside.
so a user could specify what has to be done and gets some "help" to go there.
